    <p>The idea behind the Apple Computer was to make a computer that was affordable and easy to use, for everyone. The Apple 1 was sold for $666.66 each. This earned the company over $774,000. Despite this success, there were many problems with the company. Eventually, Steve Wozniak became dissatisfied with Apple's new mission, and left the company. Also, after some expensive mistakes made by Jobs, he was kicked out of his own company. After many years of Jobs trying to get back on his feet, Apple bought out his new company and offered him back his position as CEO. Jobs got Apple back on track and made many new and unheard of innovations in the technology industry. Even after Steve Jobs's death, Apple has continued to grow and thrive, changing the world one step at at time.</p>
